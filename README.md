# Data Graph Explorer

This project is part of my data analysis learning journey. It demonstrates how to:
- Load datasets from local files or URLs
- Inspect, clean, and explore data using Pandas and NumPy
- Visualize trends and relationships with Matplotlib
- Derive insights from regional and genre-based video game sales data

## 🚀 Features

- 📂 Load `.csv` files from:
  - File upload (Colab)
  - URL input
  - Hardcoded URL
- Scatter plots and line graphs from selected columns
- Compare regional sales by console and genre
- Visualize top-selling games per region
- Extract and discuss insights from the data

## 📚 Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- Regional preferences differ significantly across platforms and genres.
- Critical reception does not always correlate with high sales.
- Understanding local market trends is key in global product strategy.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is from [this GitHub source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cs109/2014_data/master/countries.csv)
